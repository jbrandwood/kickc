/// @param n Maximum number of bytes to be used in the buffer. The generated string has a length of at most n-1, leaving space for the additional terminating null character.
/// @param format C string that contains a format string that follows the same specifications as format in printf (see printf for details).
/// @param ...  Depending on the format string, the function may expect a sequence of additional arguments, each containing a value to be used to replace a format specifier in the format string (or a pointer to a storage location, for n).

/// @return The number of characters that would have been written if n had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character.
