// N Queens Problem in C Using Backtracking
//
// N Queens Problem is a famous puzzle in which n-queens are to be placed on a nxn chess board such that no two queens are in the same row, column or diagonal.
//
// This is an iterative solution.

// Generates all valid placements of queens on a NxN board without recursion
// Works exactly like the recursive solution by generating all legal placements af a queen for a specific row taking into consideration the queens already placed on the rows below 
// and then moving on to generating all legal placements on the rows above.
// In practice this works like a depth first tree search where the level in the tree is the row on the board and each branch in the tree is the legal placement of a queen on that row. 
// The solution uses the board itself as a "cursor" moving through all possibilities
// When all columns on a row is exhausted move back down to the lower level and move forward one position until we are done with the last position on the first row
