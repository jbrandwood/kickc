// Example program for the Commander X16.
// Demonstrates the usage of the VERA tile map modes and layering.

// Author: Sven Van de Velde

// The default layer of the CX16 is layer 1, but the tiles are written on layer 0.
// The CX16 starts in tile map mode, 2BPP in 4 color mode, and uses 16x16 tiles.

// An explanation is given how this mode is organized, and how the tiles display and coloring works.
// Pälette offsets are explained also.
