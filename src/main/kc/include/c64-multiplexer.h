/// @file
/// A flexible sprite multiplexer routine for 32 sprites.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Once:
/// - plexInit(screen): Initialize the data structures and set the screen address
/// Each frame:
/// - Set x-pos, y-pos and pointer in PLEX_XPOS[id], PLEX_YPOS[id], PLEX_PTR[id]
/// - plexSort() Sorts the sprites according to y-positions and prepares for showing them. This uses an insertion sort that is quite fast when the relative order of the sprites does not change very much.
/// - plexShowSprite() Shows the next sprite by copying values from PLEX_XXX[] to an actual sprite. Actual sprites are used round-robin. This should be called once for each of the 24 virtual sprites.
/// - plexFreeNextYpos() Returns the Y-position where the next sprite is available to be shown (ie. the next pos where the next sprite is no longer in use showing something else).
/// - plexShowNextYpos() Returns the Y-position of the next sprite to show.
//
/// In practice a good method is to wait until the raster is beyond plexFreeNextYpos() and then call plexShowSprite(). Repeat until all 32 sprites have been shown.
/// TODO: Let the caller specify the number of sprites to use (or add PLEX_ENABLE[PLEX_COUNT])
