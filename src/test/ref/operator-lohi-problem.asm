// Illustrates problem with constant evaluation of lo/hi-operator
// $20000 /$400 results in a byte value - confusing the lo/hi-evaluation
// which currently relies on getting the type from the literal value.
// A fix could be adding support for "declared" types for constant literal values
// - enabling the lo/hi to know that their operand is a word (from the cast).
