// A KickC version of the plasma routine from the CC65 samples
// This version has an unrolled inner loop to reach 50+FPS
// This version also optimizes the inner loop by calculating the Y buffer as a set of differences
// (w)2001 by groepaz/hitmen
// Cleanup and porting to CC65 by Ullrich von Bassewitz.
// Ported to KickC by Jesper Gravgaard.
